## Directory Contents

This directory contains the scripts, notebooks, model weights, and results associated with this project.

* `BESTUNET.ckpt`: A model checkpoint file containing the saved weights of our best-performing U-Net model.
* `dino-statistics.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing statistics, potentially related to the DINO self-supervised learning framework.
* `confusion_matrix.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook used to generate and display the confusion matrix for evaluating model performance on the test set.
* `png_visualization.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for creating PNG visualizations of model predictions, heatmaps, or other results.
* `slurm-BESTUNET.out`: The standard output file from a Slurm job, containing logs from a training or inference run of the `BESTUNET` model on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.
* `test_images/`: A directory containing the image dataset used for testing and evaluating the model's performance.
* `unet-satvision_training_pipeline-inference.py`: A Python script that defines the complete pipeline for training the U-Net model on satellite imagery and running inference with it.
* `u_net_training_pipeline-inference.py`: A Python script implementing the general training and inference pipeline for the U-Net model.
